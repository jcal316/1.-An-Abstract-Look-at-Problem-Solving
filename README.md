1. Practice breaking it down! Explain as if the listener has never done it before: what are the steps
involved in tying a shoelace?

Step-1: Put shoe on.
Step-2: Grab Ends of shoe laces with both hands( one end in the right hand. one end in the left hand.)
Step-3: Cross the laces to make an X pattern. ( right hand should be holding the left lace. The Left hand should 
be holding the right lace.)
step_4: The the lace in the right hand under the X shape pattern.
Step-5: Pull laces tight.
Step-6: Take  6 inches of the lace in the right hand from the base of where the knot is.
Step-7: Pinch the lace in the right hand towards the base of the knot.
Step-8: Take the lace in the left and and wrap it around the looped lace that is in the the right hand.
Step-9: There is a small hole for the lace in the left hand to go through.
Step-10: Pull left lace just enough to make a loop equal in size compared to the oringinal loop.
Step- 11: Pull both loops tight.

2.In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?
3.What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?
Problem 2. and 3. 

If the "Say Hi" part of the program does not work then you would back track to find the problem.
First you go back and look at the User Button Click to identify a problem if there is one.
If the User Button Click is not workking then you would proceed to the User Name Input.
Since this is a small action, you should be able to identify the problem in this area.

4.Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down
issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in y
our everyday life.

Supply shortage 
On occasionally I run into the problem of being short on supplies for the clinic.

No supplies---> Order Supplies----> Tracking Number----> Supplies arrive----> Put supplies away-----> Supplies on shelf.
If ther are no supplies on the shelf I look to see if supplies need to be placed on the shelf.
if there are no supplies to be put away this means that supplies have not come in yet.
If there is no tracking number of supplies then the supplies have not been ordered yet.
If supplies have not been ordered then supplies need to be ordered to ensure supllies will come into the clinic.
